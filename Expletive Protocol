sales event
	buyer buys content
	payment is processed
	Server verifies payment
	server issues permission to network to upload to buyer
Buyer connects to nework
	if uploaders are at or below capacity
		uploaders assemble packet
			content piece that is most appropriate
				calculated by scarcity vs density of content availability in network, so that duplicates aren't sent
	elif network density over threshold
		Uploaders assess odds of success
			send most profitable pieces in order of probability of successful upload.
	Buyer computer responds, sending key to uploaders that upload verified content fastest.
	Buyer and Uploader computers connect and begin transferring files.
	Buyer computer informs tracking server of successful receipt
		based on network density, server calculates optimal time period for each node to wait between these connections to the server.
		If there is a backlog, nodes inform server of value of transactions in qeue to process, so that budgeting for additional server resources can be automated
	When Buyer's download is complete, buyer is removed from the roster of downloaders. Buyer now owns their file and can move it where they like.
