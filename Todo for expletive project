			what is the Expletive Project?
				English: The expletive project is a special kind of peer network: you buy content from an online store, and download it from other people <like you> who get paid for uploading it to you.
			Why do I care?
				Because as soon as you have it, you get money for uploading it too.
			how does it work?
				You have a program on your computer that moves the files around that you want: that program makes its own decisions internally about what to do with the files it has, based on the information we broadcast onto the internet.
